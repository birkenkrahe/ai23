Summary:
- ChatGPT's rise to fame (issues with graph)
- What's people's hangup with AI ('intelligence')
- AI is an area of massive change (in the public eye)
- Machine learning is a branch of AI
- Large Language Models (LLMs) is a branch of ML
- Contradictory reports about the benefits of AI
- Term project process follows the "Scrum"
- Recent critique of IQ research (from complexity)

Review questions:
#+begin_quote
- What are conditions for solving problems with a computer?
  1) Input data (something to work with)
  2) Transformation of the data into numbers
  3) Algorithm (something to process the data with)
- What is the purpose and meaning of IMRaD?
- What is meant by 'prompt engineering'?
- What is the problem with intelligence?

** Summary:

- There are many different use cases for Generative AI (like ChatGPT)
- Learning with AI assistance may require (more) self-control
- Today's cheating may be tomorrow's standard practice
- "Large language models are not knowledge bases but they are
  stochastic models of knowledge bases." (Tom Dietterich)

** Review questions ([[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/understanding-artificial-intelligence][DataCamp]], [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1446/assignments/syllabus][Syllabus]]):

- What's the relationship between an AI algorithm and an "AI system"?
  #+begin_notes
  1) An algorithm is a set of instructions for the computer.
  2) An AI algorithm is a trained algorithm that performs an
     optimization task for an unknown input
  3) An AI system includes both hardware and software, network and
     data storage to develop, test and deploy AI algorithms in the
     real world.
  4) E.g. ChatGPT employs a neural-network based algorithm but the
     ChatGPT app system includes a user interface (playground or
     conversation), a mobile user app or a browser-based desktop app,
     a database and network connection to retrieve and store the
     results of a session, plugins to extend the functionality, and
     much more.
  5) The algorithm and the public training data change rarely, while the
     non-algorithmic system parts and the test data change often.

- What is a "use case" anyway?
  #+begin_notes
  A "use case" is the equivalent of a case study in software
  engineering and product design. It describes how a system achieves a
  specific goal. It outlines interactions between users and the system
  to manage scope, establish requirements, manage risk. See:
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case][Wikipedia]].

  Elements of a use case:
  - System description
  - Actor description
  - Scenario example(s)

  Simple example: use case for a meal delivery application
  (Daly, 2022).
  1) *System*: Food delivery application
  2) *Scenario*: Individuals use app to place food orders directly to
     restaurants. When ordering, user is prompted to pay through app
     or pay when food arrives. Restaurant receives request through
     their system. Food is prepared, packaged, and delivered.
  3) *Actors:* customer, restaurant.
  4) *Requirements*: App must be able to: receive orders, process
     payments, communicate with restaurant.
