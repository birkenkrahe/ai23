** Summary:

- There are many different use cases for Generative AI (like ChatGPT)
- Learning with AI assistance may require (more) self-control
- Today's cheating may be tomorrow's standard practice
- "Large language models are not knowledge bases but they are
  stochastic models of knowledge bases." (Tom Dietterich)

** Review questions ([[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/understanding-artificial-intelligence][DataCamp]], [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1446/assignments/syllabus][Syllabus]]):

- What's the relationship between an AI algorithm and an "AI system"?
  #+begin_notes
  1) An algorithm is a set of instructions for the computer.
  2) An AI algorithm is a trained algorithm that performs an
     optimization task for an unknown input
  3) An AI system includes both hardware and software, network and
     data storage to develop, test and deploy AI algorithms in the
     real world.
  4) E.g. ChatGPT employs a neural-network based algorithm but the
     ChatGPT app system includes a user interface (playground or
     conversation), a mobile user app or a browser-based desktop app,
     a database and network connection to retrieve and store the
     results of a session, plugins to extend the functionality, and
     much more.
  5) The algorithm and the public training data change rarely, while the
     non-algorithmic system parts and the test data change often.
  #+end_notes
- What do you need to do to pass this class and by when?
  #+begin_notes
  - Solo presentation on an AI topic
  - Team project - develop an AI application
  - Sprint review presentations (presentation of prototype)

  #+end_notes

  #+end_notes
- What is a "use case" anyway?
  #+begin_notes
  A "use case" is the equivalent of a case study in software
  engineering and product design. It describes how a system achieves a
  specific goal. It outlines interactions between users and the system
  to manage scope, establish requirements, manage risk. See:
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case][Wikipedia]].

  Elements of a use case:
  - System description
  - Actor description
  - Scenario example(s)

  Simple example: use case for a meal delivery application
  (Daly, 2022).
  1) *System*: Food delivery application
  2) *Scenario*: Individuals use app to place food orders directly to
     restaurants. When ordering, user is prompted to pay through app
     or pay when food arrives. Restaurant receives request through
     their system. Food is prepared, packaged, and delivered.
  3) *Actors:* customer, restaurant, hardware and software producers.
  4) *Requirements*: App must be able to: receive orders, process
     payments, communicate with restaurant.

** Summary ([[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15g6RM7VjrKkfp6w02BZfqyzAMmnTxY6v?usp=drive_link][Whiteboard photos]])

- Most of the current discussion is about the AI system without the
  algorithm (because it is a black-box algorithm)
- When asked for examples of "specifically human intelligences",
  ChatGPT listed: Emotional intelligence, creativity, contextual
  understanding, generalization and transfer learning, self-awareness
  and consciousness, moral and ethical reasoning, and social
  intelligence.

- Consciousness: "Consciousness in AI: insights from the science of
  consciousness" (23 Aug 2023) - 80 page report.
  #+begin_quote
  Whether current or near-term AI systems could be conscious is a topic
  of scientific interest and increasing public concern. This report
  argues for, and exemplifies, a rigorous and empirically grounded
  approach to AI consciousness: assessing existing AI systems in detail,
  in light of our best-supported neuroscientific theories of
  consciousness. We survey several prominent scientific theories of
  consciousness, including recurrent processing theory, global workspace
  theory, higher-order theories, predictive processing, and attention
  schema theory. From these theories we derive "indicator properties" of
  consciousness, elucidated in computational terms that allow us to
  assess AI systems for these properties. We use these indicator
  properties to assess several recent AI systems, and we discuss how
  future systems might implement them. Our analysis suggests that no
  current AI systems are conscious, but also suggests that there are no
  obvious technical barriers to building AI systems which satisfy these
  indicators.

  In this introduction, Wharton Interactive's Faculty Director Ethan
  Mollick and Director of Pedagogy Lilach Mollick provide an overview
  of how large language models (LLMs) work and explain how this latest
  generation of models has impacted how we work and how we learn. They
  also discuss the different types of large language models referenced

- Games: LLMs as Dungeon Masters' Assistants (15 Aug 2023):
  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07540.pdf
  #+begin_quote
  The role of a Dungeon Master, or DM, in the game Dungeons & Dragons
  is to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.  The DM must digest
  information about the game setting and monsters, synthesize scenes
  to present to other players, and respond to the players’
  interactions with the scene. Doing all of these tasks while
  maintaining consistency within the narrative and story world is no
  small feat of human cognition, making the task tiring and
  unapproachable to new players. Large language models (LLMs) like
  GPT-3 and ChatGPT have shown remarkable abilities to generate
  coherent natural language text. In this paper, we conduct a
  formative evaluation with DMs to establish the use cases of LLMs in
  D&D and tabletop gaming generally. We introduce CALYPSO, a system of
  LLM-powered interfaces that support DMs with information and
  inspiration specific to their own scenario. CALYPSO distills game
  context into bite-sized prose and helps brainstorm ideas without
  distracting the DM from the game.  When given access to CALYPSO, DMs
  reported that it generated high-fidelity text suitable for direct
  presentation to players, and low-fidelity ideas that the DM could
  develop further while maintaining their creative agency. We see
  CALYPSO as exemplifying a paradigm of AI-augmented tools that
  provide synchronous creative assistance within established game
  worlds, and tabletop gaming more broadly

* 2.3 Sep-1

** Summary

- Among the four AI approaches (machines behaving like humans,
  machines thinking like humans, rational machines, rational agents),
  the "rational agent" approach currently has the greatest appeal.
- Rationality is computationally always bounded, and also human
  rationality is bounded (cp. Bakopoulos 1985).
- Values and objectives of the machine must be aligned with those of
  the human (as in Asimov's robot laws).

** Review: DataCamp "[[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/understanding-artificial-intelligence][Harnessing AI in organizations]]"

1. What's a "roadmap" in this context? Is there no GPS?
   #+begin_quote
   People used to orient themselves when driving or walking around
   with printed, foldable maps. GPS (global positioning system) relies
   on satellite connections so that you don't need a map anymore. An
   "AI GPS" app would in itself be a useful (AI) innovation!
   #+end_quote
2. How can AI destroy value in organizations?
   #+begin_quote
   For example, "AI for personalization" could also lead to alienation
   and decreased product loyalty if the AI gets it wrong or if the
   marketing is too offensive to values or intrusive on a daily basis.
   #+end_quote
3. What are the building blocks of an "AI-driven
   organisation"?
   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   [[../img/ai_business.png]]
4. Which of these are most important for your own AI innovation
   project at the start of planning for it - and why?
   #+begin_quote
   1) Vision = which value does your product deliver to customers?
   2) Success = how're you going to measure success?
   #+end_quote
5. Which objectives does the insurance company have for AI?
   #+begin_quote
   To make the claim processing more efficient by detecting fraud and
   automatically classifying claims including a customer service
   interface (i.e. giving customers direct access to the AI).
   #+end_quote
6. The chapter demands "cross-functional collaboration". Can you think
   of an argument against that?
   #+begin_quote
   "Collaboration" is not always the best option, especially for
   untested technologies, or if the demands are very specific
   (e.g. finance), or if the teams/departments have very different
   cultures or knowledge background (e.g. research vs. truckers).

** Review: "The human side of AI" (15')

1. What does "democratizing AI" mean, and what are potential issues
   with this approach?
   #+begin_quote
   According to DataCamp, it means different things:
   1) "bringing AI benefits to everyone and eliminate its potential
      harmful side"
   2) "designing AI tools that any human can effortlessly utilize to
      supplement many of our daily tasks requiring human intelligence"
   3) "designing AI tools that help us make decisions and conduct
      processes rather than replacing us."
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_quote
   Potential issues with this approach: What if someone does not think
   that "democratization" (or democracy even) is the best way forward
   for everything and everyone? What if someone does not want to reap
   AI benefits - should we be able to vote on not pursuing AI
   research? Much like stopping medical research on people without
   their consent.
   #+end_quote

2. When a model classifies a message as spam, what does that mean
   exactly? Does it mean that the message is harmful?
   #+begin_quote
   It means that the model has identified the message as potentially
   harmful based on an algorithm that computes the probability of the
   message being spam instead of ham based on a number of measured
   features or predictors, like: sender's information, content
   keywords, links, attachments, message structure and style,
   frequency and timing. It does NOT mean that the message IS spam
   because the model could have identified a "false positive" - which
   is when the message lands in the spam folder but shouldn't.
   #+end_quote

3. What is SHAP and what is it based on?
   #+begin_quote
   SHapley Additive exPlanations is a method (and a Python package) to
   explain the impact of predictors (features) on the result of a
   machine learning result, e.g. white-box models for (supervised)
   classification (spamfilter) and regression (trendline), or
   black-box models like neural nets.

   The approach is rooted in cooperative game theory and uses 'Shapley
   values', which are a way to fairly allocate contributions of each
   feature (or "player" in game theory terms) to the prediction.

   See also: [[https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-shap-values-machine-learning-interpretability][DataCamp tutorial]] for a Python example (workspace demo).
   #+end_quote

4. Which ethical considerations are relevant to production-level AI?
   #+begin_quote
   DataCamp: ethics and fairness; privacy; transparency;
   human-centered design; accountability and governance;
   sustainability and environment.

   - What does it mean for an AI app to be "fair"?
   - What percentage of the world-wide development effort goes into
     ethical AI as opposed to the other aspects of AI?
   - Ethics seem suspended as soon as good reasons to do so come
     along. (Curse of a society whose ethics are not rooted in
     immutable values, e.g. given by God like commandments? Notice the
     choice of words: "good" vs. "poor" (not "bad") practices.

5. Future of AI
   #+begin_quote

** SHAP tutorial (with notebook, 20')
** Preview: Interacting with ChatGPT (5')

- Covers:
  1) What can ChatGPT do,
  2) what can't it do, and
  3) how to get it to do what you want?

- My recommendation: pace yourselves. Do one subchapter at a
  time. Don't do bulimic learning - there's no test at the end of
  this, only a review discussion, and it's more important to have
  thought this through than to know a bunch of facts.

- Where the fun is: experiment! An interesting little experiment of my
  own: getting ChatGPT to do what I want.

  of Data," in IEEE Intelligent Systems, vol. 24, no. 2, pp. 8-12,
  March-April 2009, doi: 10.1109/MIS.2009.36.

  Abstract: Problems that involve interacting with humans, such as
  natural language understanding, have not proven to be solvable by
  concise, neat formulas like F = ma. Instead, the best approach
  appears to be to embrace the complexity of the domain and address it
  by harnessing the power of data: if other humans engage in the tasks
  and generate large amounts of unlabeled, noisy data, new algorithms
  can be used to build high-quality models from the data.  URL:

  #+begin_quote
  "In decades past, models of human language were wrought from the
  sweat and pencils of linguists. In the modern day, it is more common
  to think of language modeling as an exercise in probabilistic
  inference from data: we observe how words and combinations of words
  are used, and from that build computer models of what the phrases
  mean. This approach is hopeless with a small amount of data, but
  somewhere in the range of millions or billions of examples, we pass
  a threshold, and the hopeless suddenly becomes effective, and
  computer models sometimes meet or exceed human performance. This
  talk gives examples of the data available in large repositories of
  text, images, and videos, and shows some tasks that can be
  accomplished with the resulting models."

As before, all of these courses are no-code. To get most out of the
DataCamp experience, it makes sense to couple them with a few
code-based courses, either in R or in Python. Ask me for
recommendations (books, courses, tutorials) if you're interested.

- What is machine learning (ML)?
- Supervised and unsupervised ML models.
- Deep learning with neural networks.

** Review: Adopting ChatGPT - USE CASES
#+begin_quote
Elements of a use case (a software development model):
1) System, e.g. food delivery app
2) Scenario, e.g. user places food order
3) Actors, e.g. customer, restaurant, app developers
4) Requirements, e.g. app processes payments
#+end_quote

Use the proposed framework to decide if ChatGPT adoption is safe for a
few typical student use cases:
1) pair up
2) make a list of at least three student or college use cases
3) make an argument for or against the use of ChatGPT
4) present your examples (one per pair)

* 7.3 Fri-Oct-6
** ChatGPT for coding - group experiment

Go into one of three groups: documenters, syntaxers, and debuggers.

This is the exercise that we'll do in our next meeting:

1) +Documentation+: Find (or better: write) a simple piece of code or
   (better) a library that you know well so that you can judge the
   quality of the output, and that is not documented or well
   commented, and ask ChatGPT to document it. Ask for improvements.

2) +Syntax information:+ Ask ChatGPT about computer syntax that you know
   well so that you can judge the quality of the output. This could be
   a function or a more complicated statement or a function call, or
   an API. Ask for improvements or explanations.

3) +Debugging code+: take a piece of code (not too long, perhaps a game
   or something like it), code that you either wrote or understand
   well, and mess it up, then ask ChatGPT to debug it. Ask for
   explanations or for debugging with value changes, parameter sweeps,
   etc.

4) Visualize data: ask ChatGPT to visualize data that you understand
   and that you've visualized before or seen visualized well. Ask
   ChatGPT for customizations and improvements.

5) Communicate results: ask ChatGPT to explain an analysis or a
   result, and customize the explanation for a specific audience. Ask
   additional question.

Your job until then (and in the remainder of today's session) is to
identify targets for your group activity.

On Friday, you'll do the experiment with ChatGPT, record and present
your experiences. Depending on the outcome, we might take another
step after the break, perhaps with GitHub Copilot or Google Bard.

To emphasize: the deeper your knowledge and understanding of the
underlying material (documentation, syntax, error, dataset), the
better your ability to judge ChatGPT's output.

The more you know, the more you'll learn.

2. How are you using machine learning daily? ([[https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-101-how-ai-helps-predict-traffic-and-determine-routes/][link]])([[https://ml4a.net/][link]])([[https://www.itransition.com/machine-learning/statistics][link]])
3. What is ML? (Specifically, as opposed to AI)
   #+begin_quote
   - "A set of tools for making inferences and predictions from data
     without being explicitly programmed."
   - Prediction: future outcomes based on historical data
   - Inferences: causes and patterns based on historical data
   - Inferences help make predictions (cp. Judeah Pearl, DAG)
   - Relies on "high quality" data (most ppl use linear models)
   - All ML is data science, but some data science is not machine
     learning (e.g. Exploratory Data Analysis)
   #+end_quote
4. What are the three types of machine learning? What do they mean?
   #+begin_quote
   - Reinforcement learning (robotics)
   - Supervised learning (learning from labelled data) e.g. decision
     tree models, which are based on feature rules and correlations
   - Unsupervised learning (learning unlabelled data) e.g. k-means
     clustering, based on similarity (distance) measures.
   #+end_quote
5. What type of learning is "deep learning"?
6. What's the machine learning workflow?
   #+begin_quote
   1. Extract features from raw data
   2. Split dataset into training and testing data
   3. Train machine learning model
   4. Evaluate model checking performance on (unseen) test data
   5. Put model into production or retrain/fine-tune

   data that also aligns with people's roles in organizations that
   apply ML.
   #+end_quote
8. What are the problems with the data?
   #+begin_quote
   - Origin: We need to know where they come from.
   - Bias: We need to know if they're biased and if so, how
   - Stats: We only have a finite sample for an infinite population.
   - Performance: We may not be able to process all the data.
   - Quantification: the data may not encode what we're after.

** Trying this with the free version of ChatGPT

Stopped short of the 'optimization' step (accuracy of 30% was quite
bad).

1) Build a decision tree model from scratch. Split the data in
   training and test data, and make a prediction using the model. Then
   compute the accuracy of the model.
   #+begin_src python
     from random import shuffle
     from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

     # Create the dataset
     data_list = [
         {'Color': 'Red', 'Diameter': 7.5, 'Fruit Type': 'Apple'},
         {'Color': 'Purple', 'Diameter': 2.5, 'Fruit Type': 'Grape'},
         {'Color': 'Yellow', 'Diameter': 6.0, 'Fruit Type': 'Lemon'},
         {'Color': 'Green', 'Diameter': 4.0, 'Fruit Type': 'Apple'},
         {'Color': 'Yellow', 'Diameter': 5.5, 'Fruit Type': 'Lemon'}
     ]

     # Shuffle the data for randomness
     shuffle(data_list)

     # Split the data into training and test sets (80% training, 20% testing)
     split_ratio = 0.8
     split_index = int(len(data_list) * split_ratio)
     train_data = data_list[:split_index]
     test_data = data_list[split_index:]

     # Define a simple decision tree classifier
     def decision_tree_classifier(data):
         predictions = []
         for item in data:
             if item['Diameter'] <= 3.0:
                 predictions.append('Grape')
             elif item['Color'] == 'Red':
                 predictions.append('Apple')
             else:
                 predictions.append('Lemon')
         return predictions

     # Train the model and make predictions on the test data
     train_labels = [item['Fruit Type'] for item in train_data]
     test_labels = [item['Fruit Type'] for item in test_data]

     # Make predictions using the decision tree classifier
     predicted_labels = decision_tree_classifier(test_data)

     # Calculate the accuracy
     accuracy = accuracy_score(test_labels, predicted_labels)

     # Display the accuracy
     print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Accuracy: 100.00%

2) Make a larger dataset of 1000 lines and split it into shuffled
   training and test data in the ratio 70:30.
   #+begin_src python
     import random
     from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

     # Create a list of fruit types
     fruit_types = ['Apple', 'Grape', 'Lemon']

     # Create a larger dataset with 1000 data points
     data_list = []

     for _ in range(1000):
         color = random.choice(['Red', 'Purple', 'Yellow', 'Green'])
         diameter = round(random.uniform(2.0, 8.0), 2)
         fruit_type = random.choice(fruit_types)
         data_list.append({'Color': color, 'Diameter': diameter, 'Fruit Type': fruit_type})

     # Shuffle the dataset for randomness
     random.shuffle(data_list)

     # Split the data into training and test sets (70% training, 30% testing)
     split_ratio = 0.7
     split_index = int(len(data_list) * split_ratio)
     train_data = data_list[:split_index]
     test_data = data_list[split_index:]

     # Display the sizes of the training and test sets
     print(f"Training data size: {len(train_data)}")
     print(f"Test data size: {len(test_data)}")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Training data size: 700
   : Test data size: 300

3) Run the decision tree model from earlier on this new dataset and
   compute the accuracy of the prediction.
   #+begin_src python
     from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

     # Define the decision tree classifier function
     def decision_tree_classifier(data):
         predictions = []
         for item in data:
             if item['Diameter'] <= 3.0:
                 predictions.append('Grape')
             elif item['Color'] == 'Red':
                 predictions.append('Apple')
             else:
                 predictions.append('Lemon')
         return predictions

     # Split the new dataset into features and labels
     test_labels = [item['Fruit Type'] for item in test_data]

     # Make predictions using the decision tree classifier
     predicted_labels = decision_tree_classifier(test_data)

     # Calculate the accuracy
     accuracy = accuracy_score(test_labels, predicted_labels)

     # Display the accuracy
     print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Accuracy: 30.67%
