** Summary:

- There are many different use cases for Generative AI (like ChatGPT)
- Learning with AI assistance may require (more) self-control
- Today's cheating may be tomorrow's standard practice
- "Large language models are not knowledge bases but they are
  stochastic models of knowledge bases." (Tom Dietterich)

** Review questions ([[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/understanding-artificial-intelligence][DataCamp]], [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1446/assignments/syllabus][Syllabus]]):

- What's the relationship between an AI algorithm and an "AI system"?
  #+begin_notes
  1) An algorithm is a set of instructions for the computer.
  2) An AI algorithm is a trained algorithm that performs an
     optimization task for an unknown input
  3) An AI system includes both hardware and software, network and
     data storage to develop, test and deploy AI algorithms in the
     real world.
  4) E.g. ChatGPT employs a neural-network based algorithm but the
     ChatGPT app system includes a user interface (playground or
     conversation), a mobile user app or a browser-based desktop app,
     a database and network connection to retrieve and store the
     results of a session, plugins to extend the functionality, and
     much more.
  5) The algorithm and the public training data change rarely, while the
     non-algorithmic system parts and the test data change often.

- What do you need to do to pass this class and by when?
  #+begin_notes
  - Solo presentation on an AI topic
  - Team project - develop an AI application
  - Sprint review presentations (presentation of prototype)

  #+end_notes
- What is a "use case" anyway?
  #+begin_notes
  A "use case" is the equivalent of a case study in software
  engineering and product design. It describes how a system achieves a
  specific goal. It outlines interactions between users and the system
  to manage scope, establish requirements, manage risk. See:
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case][Wikipedia]].

  Elements of a use case:
  - System description
  - Actor description
  - Scenario example(s)

  Simple example: use case for a meal delivery application
  (Daly, 2022).
  1) *System*: Food delivery application
  2) *Scenario*: Individuals use app to place food orders directly to
     restaurants. When ordering, user is prompted to pay through app
     or pay when food arrives. Restaurant receives request through
     their system. Food is prepared, packaged, and delivered.
  3) *Actors:* customer, restaurant, hardware and software producers.
  4) *Requirements*: App must be able to: receive orders, process
     payments, communicate with restaurant.

* Plan for week 2

- What is AI?
- History of AI
- Details on team project, solo presentation, solo protocol

* Aug-28
** Summary ([[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15g6RM7VjrKkfp6w02BZfqyzAMmnTxY6v?usp=drive_link][Whiteboard photos]])

- Most of the current discussion is about the AI system without the
  algorithm (because it is a black-box algorithm)
- When asked for examples of "specifically human intelligences",
  ChatGPT listed: Emotional intelligence, creativity, contextual
  understanding, generalization and transfer learning, self-awareness
  and consciousness, moral and ethical reasoning, and social
  intelligence.

- Consciousness: "Consciousness in AI: insights from the science of
  consciousness" (23 Aug 2023) - 80 page report.
  #+begin_quote
  Whether current or near-term AI systems could be conscious is a topic
  of scientific interest and increasing public concern. This report
  argues for, and exemplifies, a rigorous and empirically grounded
  approach to AI consciousness: assessing existing AI systems in detail,
  in light of our best-supported neuroscientific theories of
  consciousness. We survey several prominent scientific theories of
  consciousness, including recurrent processing theory, global workspace
  theory, higher-order theories, predictive processing, and attention
  schema theory. From these theories we derive "indicator properties" of
  consciousness, elucidated in computational terms that allow us to
  assess AI systems for these properties. We use these indicator
  properties to assess several recent AI systems, and we discuss how
  future systems might implement them. Our analysis suggests that no
  current AI systems are conscious, but also suggests that there are no
  obvious technical barriers to building AI systems which satisfy these
  indicators.

  In this introduction, Wharton Interactive's Faculty Director Ethan
  Mollick and Director of Pedagogy Lilach Mollick provide an overview
  of how large language models (LLMs) work and explain how this latest
  generation of models has impacted how we work and how we learn. They
  also discuss the different types of large language models referenced
  in their five-part crash course: OpenAI’s ChatGPT4, Microsoft’s Bing
  in Creative Mode, and Google’s Bard.

- Games: LLMs as Dungeon Masters' Assistants (15 Aug 2023):
  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.07540.pdf
  #+begin_quote
  The role of a Dungeon Master, or DM, in the game Dungeons & Dragons
  is to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.  The DM must digest
  information about the game setting and monsters, synthesize scenes
  to present to other players, and respond to the players’
  interactions with the scene. Doing all of these tasks while
  maintaining consistency within the narrative and story world is no
  small feat of human cognition, making the task tiring and
  unapproachable to new players. Large language models (LLMs) like
  GPT-3 and ChatGPT have shown remarkable abilities to generate
  coherent natural language text. In this paper, we conduct a
  formative evaluation with DMs to establish the use cases of LLMs in
  D&D and tabletop gaming generally. We introduce CALYPSO, a system of
  LLM-powered interfaces that support DMs with information and
  inspiration specific to their own scenario. CALYPSO distills game
  context into bite-sized prose and helps brainstorm ideas without
  distracting the DM from the game.  When given access to CALYPSO, DMs
  reported that it generated high-fidelity text suitable for direct
  presentation to players, and low-fidelity ideas that the DM could
  develop further while maintaining their creative agency. We see
  CALYPSO as exemplifying a paradigm of AI-augmented tools that
  provide synchronous creative assistance within established game
  worlds, and tabletop gaming more broadly

  [[roam:https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/research/ACTEB_2023.org][the role of AI in Education]].

** Summary

- Among the four AI approaches (machines behaving like humans,
  machines thinking like humans, rational machines, rational agents),
  the "rational agent" approach currently has the greatest appeal.
- Rationality is computationally always bounded, and also human
  rationality is bounded (cp. Bakopoulos 1985).
- Values and objectives of the machine must be aligned with those of
  the human (as in Asimov's robot laws).
